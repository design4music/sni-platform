# EF Enrichment Phase: Intelligent Strategic Context

**Transform basic EF seeds into comprehensive strategic intelligence products**

## Vision

Convert raw Event Families into rich strategic intelligence through LLM-powered mini-research:
- Background research on key actors
- Historical precedent analysis
- Strategic implications assessment
- Regional impact evaluation
- Geopolitical context enrichment

## Current State → Target State

**Before (EF Seeds):**
```json
{
  "title": "Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace triggers NATO-EU security response",
  "summary": "Russian military drone violation prompts Polish closures, EU debates, UN confrontation",
  "key_actors": ["PL", "UA", "UN", "US"],
  "events": [{"summary": "Russian drones violate Polish airspace", "date": "2025-09-11"}]
}
```

**After (Enriched EF):**
```json
{
  "title": "Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace triggers NATO-EU security response",
  "summary": "Russian military drone violation prompts Polish closures, EU debates, UN confrontation",
  "strategic_context": {
    "background_research": "Poland hosts critical NATO logistics for Ukraine aid; previous airspace violations include...",
    "historical_precedents": "Similar incidents: Turkey-Syria 2015, Estonia cyberattacks 2007...",
    "geopolitical_implications": "Tests Article 5 thresholds, escalation risks, NATO unity...",
    "regional_impact": "Eastern European defense posture, US-EU coordination...",
    "key_players_analysis": {
      "Poland": "Frontline NATO state, Ukrainian aid corridor...",
      "Russia": "Hybrid warfare tactics, testing Western resolve..."
    }
  },
  "intelligence_confidence": 0.85,
  "research_sources": ["NATO Article 5 precedents", "Poland-Russia relations 2020-2025"],
  "strategic_indicators": ["NATO_ARTICLE5_TEST", "HYBRID_WARFARE", "ESCALATION_PROBE"]
}
```

## Architecture Design

### 1. EF Enrichment Processor (`ef_enrichment_processor.py`)

**Processing Flow:**
```
EF Seeds → Research Topics → LLM Mini-Research → Strategic Context → Enriched EFs
```

**Core Functions:**
- Identify research-worthy EFs (recent, high-impact, strategic significance)
- Generate research topics from EF content and actors
- Conduct LLM mini-research on each topic
- Synthesize research into strategic context
- Update EF with enriched intelligence

### 2. Strategic Research Engine (`strategic_researcher.py`)

**Research Areas:**
- **Background Research**: Actor profiles, current situations, recent developments
- **Historical Precedents**: Similar incidents, outcomes, patterns
- **Geopolitical Context**: Regional dynamics, alliance implications, power balances
- **Strategic Implications**: Escalation risks, policy responses, long-term trends
- **Regional Impact**: Geographic consequences, neighboring state reactions

**LLM Research Prompts:**
```python
BACKGROUND_RESEARCH_PROMPT = """
Research the background context for this strategic event:
{ef_summary}

Key actors: {key_actors}
Event date: {event_date}

Provide:
1. Current situation analysis for each key actor
2. Recent relevant developments (past 6 months)
3. Strategic motivations and objectives
4. Capabilities and constraints
"""

HISTORICAL_PRECEDENTS_PROMPT = """
Identify historical precedents for this strategic event:
{ef_summary}

Find similar incidents involving:
- Same actors or regions
- Similar event types or dynamics
- Comparable strategic implications

For each precedent, provide:
1. Brief description and date
2. Key similarities to current event
3. Outcome and consequences
4. Lessons learned
"""
```

### 3. Intelligence Synthesis Engine (`intelligence_synthesizer.py`)

**Synthesis Functions:**
- Combine multiple research streams into coherent strategic context
- Identify key strategic indicators and patterns
- Assess confidence levels based on source quality
- Generate actionable intelligence insights
- Extract strategic implications and predictions

### 4. Database Schema Extensions

**New EF Fields:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE event_families ADD COLUMN strategic_context JSONB;
ALTER TABLE event_families ADD COLUMN research_metadata JSONB;
ALTER TABLE event_families ADD COLUMN intelligence_confidence FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE event_families ADD COLUMN strategic_indicators TEXT[];
ALTER TABLE event_families ADD COLUMN enrichment_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending';
ALTER TABLE event_families ADD COLUMN enriched_at TIMESTAMP;
```

**Strategic Context Schema:**
```json
{
  "background_research": "String analysis",
  "historical_precedents": [
    {
      "incident": "Description",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "similarities": "How it relates",
      "outcome": "What happened",
      "lessons": "Implications"
    }
  ],
  "geopolitical_implications": "Strategic analysis",
  "regional_impact": "Geographic consequences",
  "key_players_analysis": {
    "actor_code": "Strategic profile and motivations"
  },
  "strategic_assessment": "Overall intelligence synthesis"
}
```
