  ✅ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED - SNI Pipeline Phase 2 Complete
1.09.2025 - 
Bucketless processing / ingested titles are first Gated with gate_reason: strategic_hit/no_strategic
Then Entity Enrichment adds JSON values to strategic titles only - this mechanism replaces buckets

  Final Status Report

  Database Processing Results:
  - 22,426 total titles processed
  - 0 pending titles (100% completion target achieved!)
  - 7,501 strategic titles identified (33.4% strategic rate)
  - 14,925 non-strategic titles filtered out
  - Strategic titles with entities: 100% coverage achieved

  What Was Accomplished Today

  Step 1: ✅ Completed - Architectural Work Committed
  - Successfully committed 7 logical commits for Phase 2 transition
  - All bucketless architecture components preserved
  - Database migrations, Enhanced CLUST-1, GEN-1 modules documented

  Step 2: ✅ Completed - Pipeline Testing & Validation
  - RSS ingestion: 2,586 new titles successfully ingested
  - Strategic gate processing: 9,580 titles processed (0 pending achieved)
  - Entity enrichment: 100% strategic titles enriched with actors

  Why It Didn't Work Smoothly Initially

  1. Import Path Issues: The new scripts had from apps.filter.* imports that failed when run directly. Solution: Use python -m
  apps.filter.module_name
  2. Hidden Working Scripts: The working pipeline used apps/filter/run_gate.py (not the new run_enhanced_gate.py) for strategic
  filtering
  3. Sequential Dependencies: Entity enrichment only works AFTER strategic gate processing marks titles as strategic

  Correct Processing Order

  1. RSS Ingestion:           apps/ingest/run_ingestion.py
  2. Strategic Gate:          apps/filter/run_gate.py
  3. Entity Enrichment:       python -m apps.filter.entity_enrichment
  4. [Future] GEN-1 Direct:   apps/generate/run_gen1.py

  CLUST-1 Scripts - Deprecation Analysis

  ✅ Keep (Working & Essential):
  - run_gate.py - Core strategic filtering (working)
  - entity_enrichment.py - Strategic entity extraction (working)
  - taxonomy_extractor.py - Vocabulary loading (dependency)
  - strategic_gate.py - Strategic filtering logic (dependency)

  ❌ Can Be Deprecated:
  - run_enhanced_gate.py - New script with import issues, duplicates run_gate.py
  - ~actor_extractor_legacy.py - Already marked as legacy
  - reset_processing.py - Utility script, rarely needed
  - vocab_loader.py - Check if still needed by other scripts

  Next Steps Ready

  - GEN-1 Processing: Update to work directly with titles table (not buckets)
  - Phase 2 Cleanup: Remove deprecated bucket tables and scripts
  - Documentation Update: Update README with correct pipeline flow
