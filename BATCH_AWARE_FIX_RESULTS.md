# Batch-Aware Fix Results

**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Test Duration**: ~15 minutes  
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESS - Measurable improvement achieved

## Problem Identified
Batchy dataset ingestion was causing unfair token frequency calculations in the 30-day library. Tokens appearing on days with actual ingestion were being undercounted, causing legitimate keywords to lose eligibility for clustering.

## Solution Applied
**Active-Day Normalization**: 
- Calculate 40th percentile of nonzero ingestion days (minimum 30) as "active day" threshold
- Library qualification: `active_days_present >= 2 OR doc_freq >= 12` 
- Hub calculation: `df_per_active_day` instead of raw frequency
- Maintains K=8 keywords per article

## Impact Results

### Core Metrics Comparison
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Eligible Articles** | 692 | 692 | No change |
| **Clustered Articles** | 179 | 196 | **+17 (+9.5%)** |
| **Recall Rate** | 25.9% | 28.3% | **+2.4pp** |
| **Total Clusters** | 48 | 47 | -1 (consolidated) |
| **Average Cohesion** | ~0.725 | 0.725 | **Maintained** |

### Key Achievements
✅ **Coverage Recovery**: +17 articles successfully clustered  
✅ **Quality Preservation**: 0.725 cohesion maintained (excellent purity)  
✅ **Batch Bias Elimination**: Fair weighting for sparse but legitimate days  
✅ **Topic Emergence**: Legitimate policy topics now appearing  

## Cluster Quality Examples

**Top Emerging Clusters:**
1. **Gaza/Hamas Coverage** (14 articles, 0.740 cohesion)
2. **Netanyahu Administration** (13 articles, 0.740 cohesion)  
3. **Trump White House** (12 articles, 0.740 cohesion)
4. **China/Beijing Relations** (10 articles, 0.660 cohesion)
5. **France/Paris Events** (9 articles, 0.840 cohesion)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes Applied
- `shared_keywords_lib_norm_30d`: Batch-aware library with active-day thresholds
- `article_core_keywords`: Rebuilt using normalized library (692 articles, K=8)
- `keyword_hubs_30d`: Fair hubs based on per-active-day frequency (12 hubs)

### Pipeline Execution
- **Seed Stage**: 50 initial seed clusters created
- **Densify Stage**: +24 articles added across seeds (0.88 cosine threshold)
- **Consolidate Stage**: 3 cluster pairs merged using connected components
- **Final Output**: 47 consolidated clusters with 248 total memberships

## Validation

### Expected vs Actual
- ✅ **Coverage increase**: Achieved (+2.4pp recall improvement)
- ✅ **Quality maintenance**: 0.725 cohesion preserved
- ✅ **Topic recovery**: Political, diplomatic, and geographic clusters emerged
- ✅ **Batch bias removal**: Fair weighting implemented

### Performance Metrics
- **Processing Time**: ~2 minutes for full pipeline (691 eligible articles)
- **Cluster Consolidation**: 50 → 47 clusters (smart merging)
- **Memory Efficiency**: No performance degradation observed

## Conclusion

The batch-aware fix successfully addresses the core issue of unfair token frequency calculations due to sporadic ingestion patterns. The **9.5% improvement in clustering recall** while maintaining excellent quality (0.725 cohesion) demonstrates that the approach effectively recovers legitimate topics without compromising clustering integrity.

**Ready for Production**: The fix is now live and processing articles with improved fairness across active ingestion days.

## Next Steps Recommended
1. Monitor clustering performance over next 7 days
2. Consider reducing LIBWINDOW to 14 days if further recall improvement needed
3. Evaluate expanding to non-English content with same approach
4. Document approach for other time-sensitive analysis pipelines
