### CLUST-1 v0.3 Breakthrough Features

#### 🎯 5 Precision Recall Tweaks
1. **Soften Hub Rule**: Top-12 hubs only (was 30) - reduces over-filtering
2. **Event+Geo Exception**: Allow event tokens + geo/person even if geo is hub
3. **Lower df + Higher K**: Library df≥2 (was 3), 8 keywords/article (was 6)  
4. **Anchored-Rare Seeds**: (lib_token, rare_token) with co_doc≥5 can seed
5. **Gentler Densify**: Cosine threshold 0.88 (was 0.90) for broader inclusion

#### 🔗 Connected Components Consolidation  
- **Jaccard Overlap Detection**: Merge clusters with ≥0.60 similarity or subset relationships
- **Union-Find Algorithm**: Efficiently consolidates overlapping cluster variants
- **TF-IDF Smart Labeling**: Geo/org + event + person prioritization (max 3 tokens)
- **Results**: 51 initial → 48 final consolidated clusters

#### 🛡️ Advanced Hub-Suppression System
- **Specificity Gating**: Require total specificity ≥0.80 for seed combinations  
- **Hub Token Filtering**: Prevent hub-dominated low-quality clusters
- **Event Exception Logic**: Policy topics like "tariffs + india" allowed
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintains 0.725 average cohesion

#### ✅ Enhanced Database Architecture
- **Materialized Views**: `shared_keywords_lib_30d`, `keyword_hubs_30d`, `keyword_specificity_30d`
- **Co-occurrence Patterns**: `pairs30` table with 128 anchored token pairs
- **Optimized Vocabulary**: 1,083 canonical tokens with df≥2
- **Performance Scaling**: Handles 1,218 eligible articles efficiently

### Top Performing Policy/Economic Clusters (v0.3)
1. **Vladimir Putin Russia** (7 articles) - High-level diplomatic relations
2. **Trump Tariffs US** (4 articles) - Trade policy implementation  
3. **India Tariffs** (3 articles) - Economic impact analysis
4. **Brazil-India-US Trade** (3 articles) - Multi-country economic relations
5. **Russia Oil Sanctions** (5 articles) - Energy policy and geopolitics
6. **Witkoff Moscow Diplomacy** (5 articles) - Diplomatic mission coverage

## Technical Implementation (CLUST-1 v0.3)

### Core Pipeline Components
- **`etl_pipeline/clustering/clust1_taxonomy_graph.py`**: 4-stage clustering with hub-suppression
- **`etl_pipeline/keywords/canonicalizer.py`**: Advanced canonicalization engine  
- **`etl_pipeline/keywords/extract_short_text.py`**: Short-text keyword extraction
- **`update_recall_tweaks.py`**: Materialized view optimization
- **`create_pairs30.py`**: Co-occurrence pattern analysis

### CLUST-1 v0.3 Pipeline Stages
1. **Seed Stage**: Hub-suppressed seeding with event+geo exceptions
2. **Densify Stage**: Shared-nonhub admission with 0.88 cosine threshold  
3. **Consolidate Stage**: Connected components merging via union-find
4. **Refine Stage**: Giant cluster splitting (size>80, entropy>2.4)
5. **Persist Stage**: TF-IDF labeling and database storage

### Processing Statistics (v0.3)
- **1,218 articles** eligible for clustering (79.1% coverage)
- **242 articles** successfully clustered (19.9% recall)
- **48 consolidated clusters** with 0.725 average cohesion
- **128 anchored token pairs** for rare seed patterns
- **12 hub tokens** (optimized from 30 for better recall)

### Quality Assurance
