    title: Replace Neo4j graph clustering with centroid-based architecture
    rationale:
      - Graph clustering was expensive and opaque
      - PostgreSQL-only architecture reduces complexity
      - Centroids provide explicit, auditable narrative anchors
    consequences:
      - No emergent topic discovery
      - Manual centroid curation required

    title: Adopt CTM (Centroid–Track–Month) as atomic intelligence unit
    rationale:
      - Aligns aggregation with strategic time horizons
      - Prevents narrative drift across months
      - Simplifies frontend consumption
    consequences:
      - Titles are demoted to inputs
      - CTMs become primary analysis objects

    status: accepted
    title: Restrict LLMs to judgment-only tasks
    rationale:
      - LLMs are unreliable for structural grouping
      - Determinism required for clustering
    scope:
      - Track assignment
      - Event extraction
      - Narrative summarization

    title: Introduce stop-word and language false-positive filtering
    rationale:
      - Prevent cultural/sport contamination
      - Eliminate Romance-language alias collisions
    impact:
      - Reduced false positives
      - Cleaner systemic centroids

    status: accepted
    title: Implement dynamic track configuration system
    rationale:
      - One-size-fits-all tracks reduce precision
      - Domains require domain-specific track vocabularies
    consequences:
      - Track logic moves to database
      - No redeploy required for track edits
