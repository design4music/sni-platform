    title: Replace Neo4j graph clustering with centroid-based architecture
    rationale:
      - Graph clustering was expensive and opaque
      - PostgreSQL-only architecture reduces complexity
      - Centroids provide explicit, auditable narrative anchors
    consequences:
      - No emergent topic discovery
      - Manual centroid curation required

    title: Adopt CTM (Centroid–Track–Month) as atomic intelligence unit
    rationale:
      - Aligns aggregation with strategic time horizons
      - Prevents narrative drift across months
      - Simplifies frontend consumption
    consequences:
      - Titles are demoted to inputs
      - CTMs become primary analysis objects

    title: Restrict LLMs to judgment-only tasks
    rationale:
      - LLMs are unreliable for structural grouping
      - Determinism required for clustering
    scope:
      - Track assignment
      - Event extraction
      - Narrative summarization

    title: Introduce stop-word and language false-positive filtering
    rationale:
      - Prevent cultural/sport contamination
      - Eliminate Romance-language alias collisions
    impact:
      - Reduced false positives
      - Cleaner systemic centroids

    title: Implement dynamic track configuration system
    rationale:
      - One-size-fits-all tracks reduce precision
      - Domains require domain-specific track vocabularies
    consequences:
      - Track logic moves to database
      - No redeploy required for track edits

    title: Switch from sequential 3-pass early-exit to accumulative centroid matching
    rationale:
      - Sequential passes missed bilateral relationships (Denmark+Trump matched only Denmark)
      - Early-exit prevented multi-centroid assignment needed for relationship tracking
      - Accumulative matching enables comprehensive event aggregation per centroid
      - Supports bilateral relationship queries (all US-Russia interaction events)
    consequences:
      - Higher centroid assignments per title (44% multi-centroid vs ~5% before)
      - Increased CTM volume (more centroids per title → more CTMs)
      - Pass concept obsolete (all patterns checked regardless of centroid class)
      - Removed is_macro field from centroids_v3 schema
    implementation:
      - Hash-based single-word matching (O(1) lookup, 3600+ aliases)
      - Precompiled regex patterns (1700+ patterns compiled once)
      - Script-aware matching (word boundaries for ASCII, substring for CJK/Arabic)
      - Batched database updates for 2K+ titles/day scale
      - Hyphenated compound splitting (China-made matches China)
      - Diacritic normalization (Côte d'Ivoire matches Cote d'Ivoire)
    performance:
      - Coverage increased from ~45% to 66.5% on test dataset (872 titles)
      - Multi-centroid rate: 44% (259/580 matched titles)
      - Centroid coverage: 77.6% (66/85 centroids matched)
