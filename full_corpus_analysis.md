|-------|--------|--------|----------------------|------------|
| 1 | ❌ Failed | 1000 | 0 | LLM call failed |
| 2 | ✅ Success | 1000 | 6 | NATO border crisis, Gaza ops, Trump policies |
| 3 | ❌ Failed | 1000 | 0 | LLM call failed |
| 4 | ❌ Failed | 1000 | 0 | JSON parsing error |
| 5 | ❌ Failed | 1000 | 0 | LLM call failed |

| 7 | ✅ Success | 1000 | 6 | Ukraine saga, Iran nuclear, BRICS expansion |
| 8 | ❌ Failed | 483 | 0 | LLM call failed |

**Success Rate**: 3 out of 8 batches (37.5%) successfully processed
**Title Assignment**: Only 162 out of 7,483 titles (2.2%) were assigned to Event Families

## Merging Architecture Performance

### Successful Merges Identified
The continuous merging system successfully identified and executed 6 merges:

1. **Ukraine Theater Consolidation**
   - "Ukraine-Russia Military Conflict Saga" → consolidated EF
   - "Russia-Ukraine Conflict Escalation Saga" → consolidated EF
   - **Rationale**: Same strategic situation with complementary perspectives

2. **Gaza Theater Consolidation** 
   - "Gaza Military Operations and Humanitarian Crisis Saga" → consolidated EF
   - "Israel-Gaza Military Operations Saga" → consolidated EF
   - **Rationale**: Different facets of same ongoing Gaza-Israel operations

3. **Europe Security Consolidation**
   - "NATO-Russia Border Tensions: Polish Airspace Violation" → consolidated EF
   - "Poland-Belarus Border Security Crisis" → consolidated EF
   - **Rationale**: Interconnected NATO eastern flank security tensions

### EF Key System Effectiveness
- **No key collisions**: All ef_keys are unique (no automatic merges triggered)
- **LLM-based merging**: All 6 merges required LLM evaluation due to actor set differences
- **Theater/Type matching**: System correctly identified related EFs in same theaters

## Theater Distribution Analysis

| Theater | Active EFs | Total Titles | Avg Titles/EF |
|---------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| EUROPE_SECURITY | 5 | 12 | 2.4 |
| US_DOMESTIC | 4 | 24 | 6.0 |
| GLOBAL_SUMMIT | 3 | 21 | 7.0 |
| CHINA_TRADE | 2 | 18 | 9.0 |
| GAZA | 2 | 16 | 8.0 |
| UKRAINE | 2 | 2 | 1.0 |
| MEAST_REGIONAL | 2 | 8 | 4.0 |
| IRAN_NUCLEAR | 1 | 15 | 15.0 |
| KOREA_PENINSULA | 1 | 1 | 1.0 |
| LATAM_REGIONAL | 1 | 5 | 5.0 |

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. LLM API Reliability Issues
- **50% batch failure rate** due to API timeouts and errors
- **Root cause**: Potential rate limiting or DeepSeek API instability
- **Impact**: Only 37.5% of content successfully processed

### 2. Low Processing Efficiency
- **2.2% assignment rate** indicates most strategic content isn't being grouped
- **Possible causes**:
  - Scope calibration too strict (creating too few, too large EFs)
  - LLM prompts requiring very high coherence thresholds
  - Insufficient batch diversity for EF formation

### 3. Inconsistent Theater Classification
- **Indonesia classified as LATAM_REGIONAL**: Clear misclassification
- **Geographic boundaries unclear**: Need better theater definitions

## Scope Calibration Observations

### EF Size Distribution
- **Large EFs**: Iran Nuclear (15 titles), Gaza Humanitarian (16 titles), Ukraine Conflict (20 titles)
- **Small EFs**: Multiple EFs with 1-6 titles
- **Anti-fragmentation goal**: System successfully creates large, consolidated EFs when possible

### Sample High-Quality EFs Created
1. **"Ukraine-Russia Military Conflict Saga"** (20 titles)
   - Demonstrates successful long-lived saga assembly
   - Consolidated multiple related incidents into coherent narrative

2. **"BRICS Economic Expansion and De-dollarization Efforts"** (10 titles)
   - Shows effective economic event family creation
   - Cross-national scope appropriate for topic

3. **"Iran Nuclear Program and Sanctions Saga"** (15 titles)
   - Multi-actor (Iran, US, EU, Israel) consolidation
   - Long-term strategic narrative

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **API Reliability**: Implement retry logic and error handling for LLM failures
2. **Theater Classification**: Fix Indonesia misclassification, review theater taxonomy
3. **Batch Processing**: Add smaller batch sizes as fallback for failed large batches

### System Optimization
1. **Scope Calibration**: 
   - Review coherence thresholds (may be too strict)
   - Consider processing smaller batches to improve EF formation rates
   - Analyze the 7,321 unprocessed titles for patterns

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Track batch success rates over time
   - Monitor EF size distribution for optimal consolidation
   - Add metrics for theater classification accuracy

### Architectural Improvements
1. **Fault Tolerance**: Implement graceful degradation for partial batch failures
2. **Processing Strategy**: Consider hybrid approach with smaller batches for reliability
3. **Quality Assurance**: Add validation for theater assignments and actor normalization

## Conclusion

The full corpus processing run provided valuable insights into system performance at scale:

**Successes:**
- Continuous merging architecture works (6 successful merges)
- EF Key system enables deterministic merging decisions
- Large-scale EF consolidation achieves anti-fragmentation goals

**Critical Issues:**
- 50% batch failure rate severely limits throughput
- 2.2% processing efficiency indicates scope calibration needs adjustment
- API reliability is the primary bottleneck

**Next Steps:**
- Address API reliability and retry logic
- Calibrate scope settings for higher processing efficiency
- Implement fault-tolerant batch processing strategy
