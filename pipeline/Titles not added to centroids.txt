## 1. These titles are genuinely strategic — but not “theater-obvious”

Rough categorization of the list:

### A. Governance / institutional power (clearly strategic)

Examples:

* “ICE documents reveal plan to hold 80,000 immigrants in warehouses”
* “The EU wants to end the era of national vetoes – but it's complicated”
* “New corruption scandal erupts in Kiev”
* “Kiev sacking commanders after loss of key Donbass city – media”
* “Conservative backlash brews over DEI efforts of U-Va.’s next president”

These are **systemic governance signals**, not cultural noise.
They directly map to:

* governance_internal
* institutional legitimacy
* regime stability

They are *exactly* the kind of content SNI is supposed to surface.

---

### B. Economy / finance / material constraints (strategic)

Examples:

* “Bankruptcies soar as companies grapple with inflation, tariffs”
* “Economic growth surges in late summer, the highest in two years”
* “Ruble becomes strongest-performing currency in 2025 — Bloomberg”
* “Platinum hits record high on tight supply, EU combustion-engine ban reversal”
* “Silver crosses $77 mark while gold, platinum stretch record highs”

These are **macro-economic stress and signal indicators**.
They are not lifestyle finance.

This content is strategic *even without explicit country names*.

---

### C. Military / security signals (obvious misses)

Examples:

* “Liberation of Kosovtsevo brings area of over 23 sq km under control”
* “Kiev loses about 20 battalions in fighting near Vilcha”
* “Eight Tu-214 aircraft may be produced in 2026”
* “Su-57 fighter jet successfully evades enemy radars”
* “Baikonur spaceport, Soyuz-5 carrier rocket ready for first launch”

These should **never** be out_of_scope.
Their exclusion is a **hard centroid coverage failure**, not ambiguity.

---

### D. Tech as strategic infrastructure (not lifestyle tech)

Examples:

* “When robot taxis get stuck, a secret army of humans comes to the rescue”
* “Waymo's San Francisco outage raises doubts over robotaxi readiness during crises”
* “Breakingviews - Chatbots find their voice as audio assistants rise”
* “This expert predicts superintelligence could make ‘everybody economically obsolete’”

These are **systemic technology adoption & resilience signals**, not gadgets.

They belong under:

* SYS-TECH
* governance / resilience
* economic competition

---

### E. Information, law, and legitimacy erosion

Examples:

* Epstein file cluster
* “What we know (and don’t) about the Epstein files’ release”
* “With more than a million pages to go, Justice struggles with Epstein files”

This is **institutional trust + information management**, not celebrity gossip.
The fact that it is treated as non-strategic reveals a **category blind spot**.
