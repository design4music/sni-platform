# SNI v3 Pipeline (Centroid + CTM)

This branch contains the operational SNI v3 pipeline implementation.

## Start Here (Mandatory)

Before reading code, inspecting the database, or proposing changes:
1. Read and follow: `./context/00__README.md`
2. Then consult: `V3_PIPELINE_STATUS.md` (implementation + schemas + file map)

## Operational Notes
- Development workflow / git hygiene: `DEV_SESSION_PLAYBOOK.md`

## What to Avoid
Do not use this README as an architectural reference.
The authoritative project intent and model live in `./context/`.
