# Neo4j Implementation - Steps 1 & 2 Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented Neo4j graph database integration for SNI v2 pipeline following Deepseek's progressive plan. Minimal, focused implementation with no overengineering.

## Step 1: Basic Neo4j Setup & Title Sync

**Status**: COMPLETE

### What was built:
1. **core/neo4j_sync.py** (272 lines)
   - Async Neo4j driver service
   - `sync_title()` - Syncs titles and entities to Neo4j graph
   - `find_strategic_neighbors()` - Finds titles sharing entities
   - `expand_cluster()` - For future P3 clustering enhancement
   - Synchronous wrapper for sync code integration

2. **Integration with P1 ingestion**
   - Modified `apps/ingest/rss_fetcher.py`
   - Titles automatically sync to Neo4j after PostgreSQL insert
   - Best-effort, non-blocking (failures logged, don't break pipeline)

3. **Test suite** (`tests/test_neo4j.py`)
   - Connection test: PASS
   - Title sync test: PASS
   - Strategic neighbors test: PASS
   - Cluster expansion test: PASS

### Verified working:
- Neo4j running in Docker (port 7474/7687)
- 43 titles synced during test ingestion
- P1 pipeline continues working if Neo4j fails

## Step 2: Neo4j-Powered P2 Enhancement

**Status**: COMPLETE

### What was built:
1. **core/neo4j_enhancements.py** (50 lines, minimal!)
   - `Neo4jEnhancements` class
   - `enhance_p2_decision()` - Uses graph relationships for borderline cases

2. **apps/filter/enhanced_p2_filter.py** (80 lines)
   - Three-stage filtering orchestration:
     - Stage 1: Mechanical filters (fast, deterministic)
     - Stage 2: Neo4j enhancement (graph relationships)
     - Stage 3: Fallback to non-strategic (future: LLM)
   - Keeps existing `strategic_gate.py` unchanged (no breaking changes)

3. **Test suite** (`tests/test_enhanced_p2.py`)
   - Mechanical strategic pass: PASS
   - Borderline Neo4j check: PASS
   - Clear non-strategic: PASS
   - No entities fallback: PASS

### How it works:
```
Title → Mechanical Filter
         ├─ Strong signal → KEEP/REJECT
         └─ Borderline → Check Neo4j
                          ├─ Shares 3+ entities with strategic content → KEEP
                          └─ No strong connections → REJECT
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Why minimal?
- User requested no overengineering
- Deepseek's 60-line examples preferred over 180-line verbose versions
- Only implement what's needed NOW, add later if required

### Why async?
- Neo4j Python driver is async-first
- Non-blocking P1 ingestion (don't slow down RSS fetching)
- Future-ready for async P2/P3 processing

### Why separate enhanced_p2_filter.py?
- Doesn't break existing `strategic_gate.py`
- Clean orchestration layer
- Easy to A/B test old vs enhanced filtering

---

## Next Steps (Step 3+)

Per Deepseek's plan:
- **Step 3**: P3 cluster expansion with Neo4j entity relationships
- **Step 4**: Neo4j Browser visualization queries
- Let it run 24 hours to accumulate graph data first

```bash
python tests/test_enhanced_p2.py
```

### Check titles in Neo4j:
```bash
python check_neo4j_titles.py
```

### Open Neo4j Browser:
