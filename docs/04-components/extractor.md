_Last updated: 2025-08-18 • Status: draft • Owner: Max (PO) / Claude Code (Engineer)_

**Purpose**  
Plain-language summary (1–2 sentences). What this module does and why it exists.

**Inputs**  
- Fields / types / tables consumed.
- Preconditions.

**Outputs**  
- Fields / types / tables produced.

- Key steps as bullets, no math or code.

**Config knobs** (from `/docs/05-config/thresholds.md`)  
- List flags and thresholds this module reads.

**Dependencies**  
- Upstream modules → this module → downstream modules.

**Failure modes**  
- Common errors; how they are detected (logs/metrics).

**Quality gates**  
- e.g., silhouette ≥ 0.50, cluster size ≥ 3, stopword leakage < 1%.

**KPIs**  
- What “good” looks like numerically.

**Code refs (to be filled by Claude)**  
- File path(s), function names.
