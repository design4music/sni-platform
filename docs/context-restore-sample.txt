Right, we are in transition phase making changes to our architecture and processing pipeline.
  1. Check README.md - it is outdated when describes architecture but gives a general idea. Pay attention to "### Process Rules -
  Better Development Workflow"
  2. Check docs/sni_headlines_narrative_intelligence_context_pack_v_1.md and docs/sni_engineering_playbook_appendix_d.md - both
  outdated in details but serve as a good project foundation.
  3. Now, what we are chaning - we depricate buckets: db tables `buckets` and `bucket_members`. This clustering method turned out
  to be inefficient. Instead we write strategic actors (from /data/actors.csv and data/go_people.csv) that match with the title
  text into titles.entities field as a json object. - This has been working already!

  Next steps (you are welcome to propose different!)
  1. Make commits to whatever we have done but haven't commited yet. Maybe it will help you to see the most recent development that
   is undocumented.
  2. We can run the scripts that already work: rss ingestion (apps/ingest/run_ingestion.py) and Clust-1 processing (this is
  trickier... maybe you can identify what needs to run and in what order? apps/clust1/run_enhanced_gate.py,
  taxonomy_extractor.py(?), entity_enrichment.py)...
  3. Review results and document the correct pipeline steps.

  After that we have the following directions open:
  a) Research why we couldn't update titles.processing_status=pending to gated (on several thousand items). We want to complete
  this processing step for all items in the titles table.
  b) Do the next step - EF generation. Check apps/gen1/ folder. We have it working fairly well... but with "buckets" table. We need
   to change the scripts to work directly with the "titles" table. So, logic doesn't change but targetting correct db table and
  batching procesing need updates.
  c) After that we need to make a thorough clean-up, update our documentation, and plan next phase - narrative generation.

  I want to specifically ask you not to rush, always step level up to prioritize architecture and planning, share with me several
  next steps in your plan, so that I knew what's on your mind and had a good idea of the progress. Also don't be shy to 1) ask 2)
  propose
  Small things - NEVER use emoji or nicode characters in code. Ideally you don't ask for permission to read documents. Read
  anything you need without pausing.
