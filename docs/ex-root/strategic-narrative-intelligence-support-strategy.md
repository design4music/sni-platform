```
Template: AI Capability Introduction
Subject: Understanding Your AI Narrative Analyst

Hi [Name],

Welcome to Strategic Narrative Intelligence! Your AI analyst is powerful, but like any expert colleague, works best when you understand its strengths and current limitations.

What your AI excels at:
• Identifying narrative patterns across large datasets
• Detecting sentiment shifts and thematic evolution
• Comparing narrative strategies across time periods
• Highlighting statistical anomalies in content

What to keep in mind:
• AI suggestions should be validated with domain expertise
• Cultural context may need human interpretation
• Initial accuracy improves with your feedback
• Complex strategic decisions require human judgment

Your success journey:
Week 1: Explore with sample data
Week 2: Upload your first real dataset
Week 3: Interpret results with our AI accuracy guide
Week 4: Share insights and gather internal feedback
