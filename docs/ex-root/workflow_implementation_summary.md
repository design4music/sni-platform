# Manual Parent Narrative Curation System Implementation Summary
**Strategic Narrative Intelligence Platform**
**Completed: August 18, 2025**

## Overview

Successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive manual curation workflow system that addresses the strategic narrative granularity issues identified in SNI analytics. The solution transforms chaotic clustering outputs into strategic intelligence through intelligent automation and human editorial oversight.

## Problem Solved

**Before**: 5 parents for 17 final clusters (0.29 ratio) - insufficient strategic consolidation
**After**: Intelligent workflow system targeting 0.40-0.60 consolidation ratio with strategic quality gates

## System Architecture

### 1. Foundation Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- **Database Schema**: Enhanced `narratives` table with curation workflow columns
- **Workflow States**: `auto_generated → manual_draft → pending_review → approved → published`
- **ManualNarrativeManager**: Core business logic for curation operations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all curation actions
- **API Integration**: FastAPI endpoints for dashboard operations

### 2. Intelligent Trigger System ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `C:\Users\Maksim\Documents\SNI\curation_trigger_analyzer.py`

**Capabilities**:
- **Thematic Density Analysis**: Identifies 3+ clusters sharing strategic keywords
- **Temporal Clustering**: Detects coordinated theme emergence (5+ clusters in 48 hours)
- **Strategic Keyword Monitoring**: Prioritizes geopolitical/security/economic themes
- **Source Diversity Validation**: Confirms cross-source thematic consistency
- **Priority Scoring**: Ranks opportunities by strategic significance

**Daily Operation**:
```bash
python curation_trigger_analyzer.py --days 7 --output daily_triggers.json
```

### 3. Strategic Parent Creation Process ✅ COMPLETED
**Quality Gates Implemented**:
- Strategic significance validation (geopolitics, policy, security focus)
- Narrative coherence verification (logical thematic flow)
- Temporal consistency checking (events logically connected)
- Cross-source validation requirements
- Editorial standards enforcement

**Creation Workflow**:
1. **Strategic Assessment**: Theme boundaries, impact analysis, consolidation value
2. **Content Assembly**: Cluster selection, narrative synthesis, framing analysis
3. **Editorial Refinement**: Title optimization, summary crafting, metadata assignment

### 4. Cluster Grouping Workflow ✅ COMPLETED
**Consolidation Algorithm**:
```python
# Grouping Criteria Matrix (weighted scoring)
keyword_overlap_score * 0.25     # Strategic term alignment
temporal_proximity_score * 0.20  # Event chronological coherence  
actor_consistency_score * 0.25   # Geopolitical entity involvement
strategic_significance_score * 0.20  # Policy/security relevance
source_diversity_score * 0.10    # Cross-validation confidence
```

**Special Handling for Major Themes**:
- **Russia/Putin (74% content)**: Consolidate into 3-4 strategic parents
- **Ukraine Conflict (8%)**: Temporal and operational grouping
- **China Relations (6%)**: Policy domain consolidation

### 5. Editorial Review Process ✅ COMPLETED
**Review Workflow**:
- **Automatic Assignment**: Based on expertise matching and workload balancing
- **Priority-Based Deadlines**: High priority (24hrs), Medium (48hrs), Low (72hrs)
- **Quality Checklist**: Strategic focus, narrative coherence, factual accuracy
- **Escalation Paths**: Overdue items auto-escalate to senior staff

### 6. Workflow Orchestration System ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `C:\Users\Maksim\Documents\SNI\manual_curation_orchestrator.py`

**Daily Workflow Stages**:
1. **Trigger Analysis**: Identify consolidation opportunities
2. **Smart Grouping**: Generate optimal cluster combinations
3. **Automated Creation**: Create high-confidence strategic parents
4. **Review Management**: Coordinate editorial workflow
5. **Performance Analytics**: Track system effectiveness

**Daily Operation**:
```bash
python manual_curation_orchestrator.py --output daily_workflow_report.json
```

- **Quality Control**: Automated validation → continuous

### Human-AI Task Division
**AI Handles**:
- Thematic pattern recognition across clusters
