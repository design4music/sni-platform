    title: Replace Neo4j graph clustering with centroid-based architecture
    rationale:
      - Graph clustering was expensive and opaque
      - PostgreSQL-only architecture reduces complexity
      - Centroids provide explicit, auditable narrative anchors
    consequences:
      - No emergent topic discovery
      - Manual centroid curation required

    title: Adopt CTM (Centroid–Track–Month) as atomic intelligence unit
    rationale:
      - Aligns aggregation with strategic time horizons
      - Prevents narrative drift across months
      - Simplifies frontend consumption
    consequences:
      - Titles are demoted to inputs
      - CTMs become primary analysis objects

    title: Restrict LLMs to judgment-only tasks
    rationale:
      - LLMs are unreliable for structural grouping
      - Determinism required for clustering
    scope:
      - Track assignment
      - Event extraction
      - Narrative summarization

    title: Introduce stop-word and language false-positive filtering
    rationale:
      - Prevent cultural/sport contamination
      - Eliminate Romance-language alias collisions
    impact:
      - Reduced false positives
      - Cleaner systemic centroids

    title: Implement dynamic track configuration system
    rationale:
      - One-size-fits-all tracks reduce precision
      - Domains require domain-specific track vocabularies
    consequences:
      - Track logic moves to database
      - No redeploy required for track edits

    title: Switch from sequential 3-pass early-exit to accumulative centroid matching
    rationale:
      - Sequential passes missed bilateral relationships (Denmark+Trump matched only Denmark)
      - Early-exit prevented multi-centroid assignment needed for relationship tracking
      - Accumulative matching enables comprehensive event aggregation per centroid
      - Supports bilateral relationship queries (all US-Russia interaction events)
    consequences:
      - Higher centroid assignments per title (44% multi-centroid vs ~5% before)
      - Increased CTM volume (more centroids per title → more CTMs)
      - Pass concept obsolete (all patterns checked regardless of centroid class)
      - Removed is_macro field from centroids_v3 schema
    implementation:
      - Hash-based single-word matching (O(1) lookup, 3600+ aliases)
      - Precompiled regex patterns (1700+ patterns compiled once)
      - Script-aware matching (word boundaries for ASCII, substring for CJK/Arabic)
      - Batched database updates for 2K+ titles/day scale
      - Hyphenated compound splitting (China-made matches China)
      - Diacritic normalization (Côte d'Ivoire matches Cote d'Ivoire)
    performance:
      - Coverage increased from ~45% to 66.5% on test dataset (872 titles)
      - Multi-centroid rate: 44% (259/580 matched titles)
      - Centroid coverage: 77.6% (66/85 centroids matched)

    title: Implement dynamic focus lines for Phase 4.2 summary generation
    rationale:
      - Prevent forced narrative coherence across thematically unrelated events
      - Enable centroid-specific and track-specific guidance for LLM
      - Address temporal drift (LLM inferring roles/titles from training data)
    implementation:
      - track_configs.llm_summary_centroid_focus (TEXT) - structural focus per centroid type
      - track_configs.llm_summary_track_focus (JSONB) - domain focus per track (GEO only)
      - Prompt allows 2-4 paragraphs based on natural thematic grouping
      - Anti-coherence instruction: "Do NOT force unrelated events into false narrative"
      - Temporal grounding: "Do NOT infer current offices or roles unless explicitly stated"
    consequences:
      - More accurate multi-event summaries (e.g., USA humanitarian CTM with Venezuela + domestic)
      - Reduced hallucination of current political roles
      - Better thematic separation in complex CTMs

    title: Complete Phase 4 daemon integration with monitoring
    rationale:
      - Phase 4 needed production orchestration alongside Phases 1-3
      - Summary length creep is a real concern as titles accumulate daily
      - Need observability for accumulation behavior before over-engineering CTW
    implementation:
      - Integrated Phase 4.1 (events) and 4.2 (summaries) into daemon
      - Added word count monitoring after each Phase 4.2 run
      - 1-hour interval for Phase 4 (less frequent than matching/assignment)
      - 50 CTM batch size for enrichment
      - Fixed SQL bug in assign_tracks.py (line 290: check title_assignments table)
    testing_plan:
      - Run daemon for 3-5 consecutive days
      - Monitor summary word counts (target: 150-250 words)
      - Track which CTMs grow fastest
      - Determine if current architecture handles accumulation or if CTW needed
    consequences:
      - Full 4-phase pipeline operational in production mode
      - Data-driven decision on CTM vs CTW architecture
      - Word count monitoring detects length bloat early

    title: Consolidate frontend documentation into CoC and Status
    rationale: >
      Frontend is a non-intelligent consumer layer. Separate frontend docs
      caused duplication and drift. All frontend knowledge now lives in
      PIPELINE_STATUS.md as descriptive state.

    title: Replace Neo4j graph clustering with centroid-based PostgreSQL architecture
    rationale: >
      The previous v2 implementation relied on Neo4j graph clustering with PageRank,
      which introduced operational complexity, cost, and opaque behavior.
      The v3 design replaces this with explicit centroid-based matching implemented
      directly in PostgreSQL. This simplifies the architecture, improves performance,
      increases debuggability, and removes the dependency on graph infrastructure,
      while preserving strategic coverage and auditability.

    title: Adopt many-to-many title–centroid–track relationships
    rationale: >
      Earlier designs forced a single track assignment per title, which caused
      logical inconsistencies when the same title was relevant to multiple centroids.
      The system now models title–centroid–track relationships explicitly, allowing
      each title to be analyzed independently in each strategic context.
      This preserves real-world complexity and prevents information loss.

    title: Apply stop-word filtering only to systemic centroid matching
    rationale: >
      Strategic clusters were contaminated by culture and sports terms when applying
      systemic matching. A stop-word list is now applied exclusively to the systemic
      pass, while theater and macro matching remain unrestricted.
      This balances recall and precision by protecting high-level geographic anchors
      while tightening mid-level thematic centroids.

    title: Mitigate Romance-language false positives in centroid matching
    rationale: >
      Romance-language articles produced false positives due to common articles
      (e.g., “il”, “la”) matching centroid aliases. The solution combined multiple
      measures: filtering Romance articles, removing uncommon ISO codes, and deleting
      ambiguous aliases (e.g., “IL” for Israel). This eliminated recurrent false
      assignments without harming recall.

    status: accepted
    title: Simplify taxonomy by removing redundant aliases
    rationale: >
      The taxonomy accumulated excessive redundancy across languages and formal names,
      increasing maintenance burden and false positives. A systematic pruning removed
      3,266 redundant aliases (22.3%) while retaining non-Latin scripts essential for
      global coverage. This improved performance, clarity, and maintainability.

    status: accepted
    title: Introduce dynamic, centroid-specific track configurations
    rationale: >
      A single universal track list forced heterogeneous content into overly generic
      classifications. The system now supports centroid-specific track configurations
      stored in the database, allowing tech, climate, and quiet geographic centroids
      to use tailored track sets. This improves classification accuracy, reduces
      fragmentation, and enables domain expertise without code redeployment.

    status: accepted
    title: Add LLM-based strategic gating before track assignment
    rationale: >
      Mechanical filtering alone allowed some non-strategic content to pass into
      Phase 3. A two-stage LLM process was introduced: first, a strategic relevance
      gate (accept/reject), followed by track assignment for accepted titles.
      Rejected titles are explicitly marked to preserve auditability.

    status: accepted
    title: Use sequential pipeline execution with adaptive scheduling
    rationale: >
      Although parallel execution is possible, the pipeline currently runs sequentially
      with phase-specific intervals. This design matches the actual bottlenecks
      (I/O-bound ingestion, fast mechanical matching, LLM-limited phases) and favors
      simplicity, observability, and debuggability. Parallelization is deferred until
      empirically required.
