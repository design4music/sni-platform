    title: Stale narratives after removing daemon auto-refresh
    context: >
      The daemon previously re-extracted narratives when entities grew significantly
      (CTMs +100 titles, events +50 sources). With Phase 5 removed from the daemon
      (D-030), narratives extracted early in a month will become stale as coverage
      accumulates. A CTM extracted at 120 titles may have 400 by month-end.
    possible_directions:
      - Refresh button on the analysis page (user-triggered re-extraction)
      - Staleness indicator showing growth since extraction (e.g., "Coverage grew 3x since analysis")
      - Automatic staleness badge based on source_count_at_extraction vs current count
    not_urgent_because: >
      Most narratives are extracted mid-to-late month when coverage is substantial.
      February is the first month with on-demand extraction. Monitor before solving.
    related_decisions:
      - D-025 (original refresh mode design)
      - D-030 (on-demand extraction replacing daemon)

    title: No re-extraction path for existing narratives
    context: >
      The extract-narratives API route returns existing narratives if any exist
      (line 32-37 of extraction_api.py). Users cannot trigger re-extraction for
      entities that already have narratives. This means early extractions persist
      even if coverage changed dramatically or extraction quality was poor.
    possible_directions:
      - Add a "Re-extract" button (separate from initial "Extract & Analyse")
      - Allow re-extraction when source count grew by a configurable threshold
      - Version narratives (keep old extraction, create new one alongside)
    not_urgent_because: >
      On-demand extraction is new. Most entities don't have narratives yet.
      The problem will become visible as the month progresses and users revisit
      previously-extracted entities. Monitor usage patterns first.

      - D-030 (on-demand extraction)
