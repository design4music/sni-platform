# EF Generation v2.1 - Implementation Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented EF Generation v2.1 with interpretive validation and intelligent merging.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Migration ✅
**File**: `db/migrations/20251023_add_processing_status.sql`

Added `processing_status` field to titles table:
- `pending` - not yet processed
- `recycling` - rejected from cluster, awaiting re-clustering
- `assigned` - successfully assigned to an EF

Index created for efficient recycling bin queries.

### 2. P3.5a: Seed Validator ✅
**File**: `apps/generate/seed_validator.py`

**Purpose**: Individual title validation before EF creation

**How it works**:
1. Generates brief theme from top 3 most frequent entities
2. Validates EACH title individually with micro-prompt:
   - "Does this headline belong to the same ongoing story as theme [{entities}]?"
   - Answer: YES or NO
3. Only creates EF if ≥3 titles validate (MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE)
4. Rejected titles → recycling bin for future re-clustering
5. Single-title clusters automatically sent to recycling

**Key features**:
- Prevents noise from entering EFs
- Micro-prompts are cheap and deterministic (temperature=0.0)
- Fail-open on errors (includes title to avoid data loss)

### 3. P3.5c: Interpretive EF Merger ✅
**File**: `apps/generate/ef_merger.py`

**Purpose**: Merge semantically similar Event Families using LLM intelligence

**How it works**:
1. Finds candidate EF pairs:
   - Must have same event_type
   - Must have same or compatible theaters (or one is Global)
2. Uses micro-prompt to validate merge:
   - "Do these two Event Families describe facets of the same broader strategic narrative?"
   - Compares strategic_purpose fields
   - Answer: YES or NO
3. If YES: Merges ef2 into ef1
   - Combines title lists (deduplicated)
   - Marks ef2 as 'merged' status
   - Updates all titles to point to ef1

**Key features**:
- Goes beyond mechanical ef_key merging
- Detects semantic similarity using strategic_purpose
- Can run as background process or on-demand
- Supports dry-run mode for testing

**CLI**: `python -m apps.generate.ef_merger [max_pairs] [--dry-run]`

### 4. P3 Integration ✅
**File**: `apps/generate/incident_processor.py` (modified)

Integrated P3.5a into Phase 3 pipeline:

**Complete Pipeline Flow**:
```
P2 (entity extraction)
↓
P3 MAP (mechanical clustering)
↓
P3 REDUCE (generate EF content + strategic_purpose)
↓
P3.5a (validate each title in EF seed) ← NEW
↓
P3 (create EF only if validated) ← ENHANCED
↓
P3.5b (assign new titles to existing EFs) ← EXISTING
↓
P3.5c (merge similar EFs) ← NEW
```

**Changes made**:
- Added seed_validator to IncidentProcessor
- New method: `_validate_event_family_seeds()` - validates EF seeds before database commit
- New method: `_mark_titles_for_recycling()` - marks rejected titles
- Validation runs between REDUCE and database upsert
- Only validated EFs (≥3 good titles) get written to database
- Rejected titles marked as 'recycling' for future processing

## Architecture Summary

### P3.5a: Seed Validation (INSIDE P3)
**When**: After REDUCE creates EF, BEFORE database commit
**Purpose**: Quality control - prevent noisy clusters
**Method**: Individual title micro-prompts vs. brief theme
**Output**: Clean EF seeds + recycling bin

### P3.5b: Cross-Batch Assignment (EXISTING)
**When**: Continuous - new incoming titles
**Purpose**: Assign to existing EFs instead of fragmenting
**Method**: Pre-filter + micro-prompts vs. strategic_purpose
**Output**: Titles assigned to appropriate EFs

### P3.5c: Interpretive Merging (BACKGROUND)
**When**: Periodically on existing EFs
**Purpose**: Merge semantically similar EFs
**Method**: Micro-prompts comparing strategic_purposes
**Output**: Consolidated EFs, reduced fragmentation

## Key Design Principles

1. **Mechanical clustering suggests, AI validation decides**
   - Fast cosine clustering for efficiency
   - Cheap micro-prompts for critical decisions

2. **Individual validation is paramount**
   - Every title gets its own YES/NO decision
   - Prevents bad clustering from polluting EFs

3. **Recycling bin philosophy**
   - Don't discard rejected titles
   - Give them another chance in future clustering cycles

4. **Strategic purpose as semantic anchor**
   - One-sentence core narrative
   - Used for both cross-batch assignment and merging
   - Generated by LLM, mechanical theater separate

## Testing

### Test P3.5a (Seed Validation)
```bash
# Standalone test
python apps/generate/seed_validator.py

# Integrated test - process new titles through P3
python -m apps.generate.incident_processor 100
# Watch for P3.5a validation logs
```

### Test P3.5b (Cross-Batch Assignment)
```bash
python -m apps.generate.thematic_validator 50
```

### Test P3.5c (Interpretive Merging)
```bash
# Dry run first
python -m apps.generate.ef_merger 20 --dry-run

# Real merge
python -m apps.generate.ef_merger 20
```

## Metrics to Monitor

1. **Seed Validation Rate**:
   - `validated_efs / total_efs` after REDUCE
   - Target: >80% validation rate

2. **Recycling Rate**:
   - `recycled_titles / total_titles_processed`
   - Target: <20% recycling rate

3. **Cross-Batch Assignment Rate**:
   - `assigned_to_existing / new_incoming_titles`
   - Target: >40% assignment to existing EFs

4. **Merge Rate**:
   - `merged_pairs / evaluated_pairs`
   - Target: 10-20% merge rate

## Database Schema Changes

### titles table
```sql
ALTER TABLE titles
ADD COLUMN processing_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending';

-- Values: 'pending', 'recycling', 'assigned'
```

### event_families table (no changes)
- Already has `strategic_purpose` (added in Phase 1)
- Already has `status` field for 'merged' tracking
- Already has `merged_into` and `merge_rationale`

## Configuration

### Seed Validator
- `MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE = 3` (minimum validated titles to create EF)
- `temperature = 0.0` (deterministic micro-prompts)
- `max_tokens = 10` (YES/NO only)

### EF Merger
- Candidate pairs filtered by: same event_type + compatible theaters
- Micro-prompt temperature: 0.0
- Can limit max_pairs to evaluate

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `db/migrations/20251023_add_processing_status.sql`
2. `apps/generate/seed_validator.py`
3. `apps/generate/ef_merger.py`
4. `docs/tickets/ef_generation_v2.1_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
1. `apps/generate/incident_processor.py`
   - Added seed_validator integration
   - Added validation between REDUCE and upsert
   - Added recycling bin handling

### Existing Files (Unchanged)
1. `apps/generate/thematic_validator.py` - P3.5b (cross-batch assignment)
2. `apps/generate/theater_inference.py` - mechanical theater assignment
3. `apps/generate/reduce_assembler.py` - REDUCE phase logic
4. `apps/generate/mapreduce_prompts.py` - LLM prompts

## Next Steps

1. **Test with production volume** (500+ titles)
2. **Monitor recycling bin growth** (should be <20%)
3. **Run periodic merging** (daily or weekly)
4. **Tune MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE** if needed (currently 3)
5. **Consider Phase 3.5d**: Interpretive Splitting (if EFs get too large)

## Success Criteria

✅ P3.5a: Seed validation prevents noisy clusters from becoming EFs
✅ P3.5b: New titles assigned to existing EFs instead of fragmenting
✅ P3.5c: Semantically similar EFs merged intelligently
✅ Recycling bin: Rejected titles get second chance
✅ Strategic purpose: Used as semantic anchor across all phases

**v2.1 Implementation: COMPLETE** 🎉
