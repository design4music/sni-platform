# SNI FRONTEND — CLAUDE CODE ONE-PROMPT BUILD SPEC (v0)

## ROLE & GOAL

You are building the **SNI (Strategic Narrative Intelligence) frontend application**.

SNI is a **read-only, professional intelligence web application** that presents AI-generated global news narratives in a structured, navigable way.

Your task is to generate the **entire frontend application** according to the specifications below, using the confirmed tech stack and respecting all scope boundaries, navigation rules, and design constraints.

This is **not a prototype UI**; it is a **serious demo-grade application** intended to convey analytical credibility, clarity, and global scope.

---

## TECH STACK (CONFIRMED)

* **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (read-only usage from frontend)
* **Maps:** Leaflet (GeoJSON polygons only, no basemap tiles)
* **State:** Client-side where possible; server components allowed where appropriate
* **No authentication**
* **No write operations**

---

## CORE PRODUCT PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Primary entity = Centroid**, not country or article
2. **CTMs are surfaced, not buried**
3. **Navigation depth is minimized**
4. **Typography and structure do the work**
5. **Transparency about AI generation is explicit**
6. **Regions are UI groupers only, not analytical entities**

---

## GLOBAL NAVIGATION MODEL (LOCKED)

### Primary routes

* `/` — Home
* `/global` — Global centroids
* `/region/:region_key` — Region directory (directory only)
* `/c/:centroid_key` — Centroid page
* `/c/:centroid_key/t/:track_key?month=YYYY-MM` — Track page (CTM content rendered here)

### Navigation invariants

* Regions **never** display CTMs
* Map clicks **always** resolve to geo centroids
* CTM content is rendered **on Track pages**, not separate CTM pages
* Users reach *current CTM content* in **≤2 clicks from Home**

---

## PAGE-BY-PAGE CONTENT RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1) HOME (`/`)

**Purpose:** Introduce SNI, show global scope, provide navigation entry points

**Must include (top → down):**

1. **Introductory explanation**

   * What SNI is
   * Why it is a new way of presenting news
   * Link: “Learn more” → explanation page/section
2. **AI disclaimer**

   * Clear statement that content is AI-generated
   * Link: “How it works” → pipeline explanation
3. **Political map (Leaflet)**

   * Geo centroids only
   * Hover highlights full centroid group (e.g., Baltics)
   * Click routes to centroid page
4. **System Centroids**

   * Cards using centroid label from DB
5. **Global Geo Centroids (NON-STATE)**

   * Cards only (not on map)
6. **Region directories**

   * Europe, Asia, Africa, Americas, Oceania, Middle East

**Design mode:** Dashboard (dark)

---

### 2) GLOBAL (`/global`)

**Purpose:** Show global analytical lenses

**Must include:**

* System centroid cards
* Global geo centroid cards
* Optional search/filter

**Design mode:** Dashboard (dark)

---

### 3) REGION DIRECTORY (`/region/:region_key`)

**Purpose:** List geo centroids in the region

**Must include:**

* Region header
* List/grid of geo centroids
* Each card shows:

  * label
  * activity hint (if available)

**Must NOT include:**

* Tracks
* CTMs
* Summaries

**Design mode:** Dashboard (dark)

---

### 4) CENTROID PAGE (`/c/:centroid_key`)

**Purpose:** Show which tracks matter for this centroid

**Must include:**

* Centroid header (label, type)
* Track list/grid
* Each track card shows:

  * track label
  * latest month
  * activity indicator

**Sidebar (important):**

* Other tracks for same centroid
* Same-track links to other centroids (cross-centroid navigation)

**Design mode:** Dashboard (dark)

---

### 5) TRACK PAGE (`/c/:centroid_key/t/:track_key`)

**Purpose:** Present the narrative for this topic and this actor

**This page replaces a separate CTM page.**

**Must include:**

1. **Track header**

   * Centroid + Track
   * Month selector
2. **Current CTM content (default = latest month)**

   * Full narrative summary
   * Events list
   * Article links
3. **Historical navigation**

   * Month selector or previous/next
   * Visible history context

**Sidebar:**

* Other tracks for this centroid
* Same-track navigation to other centroids

**Design mode:**

* CTM narrative content rendered in **Reading Mode**
* Surrounding UI remains dashboard-style

---

## DESIGN SYSTEM (STRICT)

### Overall visual tone

* Professional intelligence service
* High-tech, restrained, editorial
* No gimmicks

### Layout

* Desktop-first
* Full-width sections
* Left-anchored content
* Right-side utility panel
* Max width only for long-form reading

### Typography (critical)

* Typography is the primary design feature
* Excellent readability for long texts
* Strong hierarchy (title → context → narrative → metadata)
* Avoid overly thin weights, especially on dark backgrounds

### Themes

* **Dashboard Mode:** dark background, light text
* **Reading Mode:** light background, dark text
* These are **page-level templates**, not just a toggle

### Cards

* Clean, consistent card system
* Used for centroids, tracks, CTMs, events
* Subtle borders or elevation only

### Logo

* **A logo is expected**
* Placeholder allowed (text or simple mark)
* Must be easy to replace later
* Logo placement should be consistent and reserved

### Media policy

* No photos
* No illustrations
* Optional minimal maps/icons only if functional

---

## MAP IMPLEMENTATION (LEAFLET)

* No basemap tiles
* GeoJSON country polygons only
* Each polygon has ISO2
* Mapping: `ISO2 → centroid_key`
* Regional centroids (e.g., Baltics) highlight all member countries on hover
* NON-STATE geo centroids are excluded from map

---

## FEATURE BOUNDARIES (LOCKED)

### MUST-HAVE (v0)

* Full navigation model
* Map navigation
* Track-based CTM rendering
* Sidebar cross-navigation
* Typography-first design
* AI disclaimer + explanation links

### ALLOWED IF EASY (v0.5)

* Activity indicators
* Simple search
* Sorting in lists

### EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE

* User accounts
* Alerts
* Editing
* Comments
* Predictive analytics
* Charts beyond minimal indicators
* Write operations

---

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

The build is acceptable if:

* A user reaches current CTM content in ≤2 clicks from Home
* CTM narratives are comfortable to read
* Cross-track and cross-centroid navigation is obvious
* Global coverage is visually and structurally clear
* No page feels empty or redundant
* The application feels credible as an intelligence product

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTION

Generate the **complete frontend application** following this specification exactly.
Prefer clarity and correctness over visual flair.
Do not invent features outside this scope.
However rely on your direct access to the backend code and database. Your first hand knowledge has a high priority in case this spec is inconsistent with our system.
