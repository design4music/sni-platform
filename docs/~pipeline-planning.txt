## Next Phase Planning                                                                                                        
### Phase 2B: Cleanup                                                                                                         
- Remove deprecated bucket tables                                                
- Archive legacy clustering scripts                                                                                           
- Update configuration for bucketless operation                                              
### Phase 2C: Optimization                                   
- Automated pipeline orchestration
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Enhanced narrative Generation

Simplified Pipeline Architecture

  Current Reality

  - titles.event_family_id IS NULL = needs processing
  - titles.event_family_id IS NOT NULL = already assigned, skip

  Your Proposed Flow

  1. GEN-1 Main Pipeline (simple & fast):
    - Query: WHERE gate_keep = true AND event_family_id IS NULL
    - Create new Event Families from these unassigned titles
    - No time windows needed at all!
  2. EF Consolidation (separate cron job):
    - Analyze existing EFs for potential mergers
    - "IDF Gaza Action #47" + "IDF Gaza Action #52" → merge into original EF
    - Can be sophisticated, take time, run separately

  Benefits of This Approach

  ✅ Simple main pipeline - just process unassigned titles
  ✅ No complex LLM decision logic - create new EFs, worry about consolidation later✅ Performance - fast daily processing
  without heavy analysis
  ✅ Maintainable - two separate, focused responsibilities
  ✅ Debuggable - easy to see what went wrong where

  Implementation Changes Needed

  1. Remove time constraints from get_unassigned_strategic_titles()
  2. Simple query: WHERE gate_keep = true AND event_family_id IS NULL
  3. Future: Build EF consolidation/merger service

  This is definitely the right architectural approach. Should I implement the simplified GEN-1 processing (remove since_hours,
  process ALL unassigned titles)?
